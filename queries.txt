to pet table, add
- neutered (what type is it gonna be?)
- value/price (2 decimal places), look at mysql types

create queries for
1. select the name, price of the most expensive pet
2. select the name, price of the 3 most expensive pets (see limit in mysql)
3. select the name, price of the 3 least expensive pets
4. unique pet names
5. unique pet names, but ignore different capitalisations (fLuFfY should match fluffy)
6. retrieve name, price of pets without an owner
7. select pets who are still for sale (the criteria is that they have no owner and have been neutered)
8. owner name and the number of pets owned by that owner (see “count” function in mysql)
9. select the total value of all pets
10. retrieve the different pet names and how many times that pet name was given
11. names of people who don’t own a pet
12. pets which cost > 9.99 but < 19.99, displayed by highest amount first
13. select names of pets whose owner name is “John Smith”
14. select names of owners whose name begins with “John”
15. select names of owners whose name ends in “Smith” or “Smyth”
16. select names of owners who has “av” somewhere in their name (“david” and “dave” should both match)
